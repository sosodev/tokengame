# Token Game
## Editing

VS-Code does seem work pretty well if you install the docker, go, and svelte plugins you can edit the whole stack in one place. :smile:

## Building

Be sure you have docker and docker-compose installed.

To build you can simply run `docker-compose build`

## Running

To run you can simply run `docker-compose up`
This will start both the server and the database containers

## Doing both

If you're making changes often you'll probably want to run both commands in one go. 
Then when you need to rebuild you can just press ctrl+c, up-arrow, and enter.

`docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

## Seeing it in action

navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser

this is test2 :heart:
